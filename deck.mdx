- Basscss
- CSS Stats
- Rebass
- Styled System

<Notes>

- If you work with React or design systems you may have seen some of these
- The result of working on style guides, pattern libraries, and design systems at practically every job I've ever had.

</Notes>

---

## Basscss & Tachyons

<Notes>

- Came from working together on similar problems
- Moved to NYC
- Should have combined forces

</Notes>

---

- Buzzfeed Solid
- Etsy CSS
- GitHub Primer
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS

<Notes>

- Same concept
- Similar APIs
- Different naming conventions

</Notes>

---

## Migration is possible, but not easy

<Notes>

- Start with one library
- Migrating to another
- Some amount of lock-in
- Interoperability probably wasn't a primary concern for these libraries

</Notes>

---

## Learn from the past

## Styled System

https://styled-system.com

<Notes>

- Extraction of the API from Rebass
- Meant for building custom component libraries
- Standards for prop naming conventions

</Notes>

---

```jsx
<Box
  color='white'
  bg='primary'
  p={4}
  width={[ '100%', '50%' ]}
/>
```

<Notes>

- Component-based CSS Abstraction
- Lets you style components with props
- Pulls values from a core theme object (e.g. design tokens)
- Handles mobile-first responsive styles

</Notes>

---

<ThemeTweet />

---

## Design Tokens

<Notes>

- Jina Anne's concept from work at Salesforce
- Different teams, different implementations, different libraries
- Different naming conventions

</Notes>

---

## Theme Specification

<Notes>

- This is where the theme specification comes in

</Notes>

---

<img
  src='https://system-ui.com/icon.png'
  alt='System UI'
  width='320'
  height='320'
  style={{
    width: '8em',
  }}
/>

System UI

https://system-ui.com

<Notes>

- Decoupled from implementations
- React-focused but language agnostic
- "System UI" Yes, like the font

</Notes>

---

<Frame src='https://system-ui.com/theme' />

<Notes>

- Based on approaches from Styled System
- Interest from:
- Modulz
- Smooth UI
- Material UI

</Notes>

---

## Scales

- `fontSizes`
- `colors`
- `space`
- `sizes`

<Notes>

- Provides a standard for naming
- Doesn't tell you *what* to put in a scale

</Notes>

---

## It "just works"

<Notes>

- What if:
- Different UI component libraries could be swapped
- Maintain your brand's styles
- Off-the-shelf UI doesn't require much hacking to make it match your app
- Design and development tools speak the same language

</Notes>

---

<BlocksTweet />

<Notes>

- John's been working on a rich text editor for MDX
- Called Blocks
- MDX is markdown with support for embedded React components
- In just a few minutes he added UI to change the theme in this doc

</Notes>

---

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <EditProvider>
    {props.children}
    <FieldSet name='colors' />
    <FieldSet name='fontSizes' />
  </EditProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

<Notes>

- Styled System Edit
- Wasn't really built for the MDX Blocks editor
- Uses the same theme spec
- Dev tool to add to any site

</Notes>

---

## Gatsby Themes

<Notes>

- Modern take on WP themes
- Composable
- Any Gatsby site can be turned into a "theme"
- Data-driven
- Shadowing
- Theming

</Notes>

---

## Composition

<Notes>

- Blog
- Portfolio
- Documentation
- E-commerce
- Ecosystem of themes

</Notes>

---

## Theme UI (WIP)

<Notes>

- For developing Gatsby themes
- Themeable
- Isolated Styles
- Blog styles don't stomp portfolio styles

</Notes>

- If this idea is interesting to you,
- I wrote about this more in depth on my blog

## MDX Deck

<Notes>

- Shameless plug: this presentation was created with MDX Deck
- MDX lets you use React in markdown
- SVGs, Tweet embeds, etc.
